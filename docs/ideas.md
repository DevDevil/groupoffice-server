The big idea:

Complete office environment online as simple as possible. Extensible
with modules.


# Contacts

Contact info more visual in email. What contracts does the sender have?


# Time tracking

One time entry model that can be related to various items such as:
1. Project
2. Ticket
3. Task
4. E-mail

Perhaps it should have a model name and ID property to be able to store it to any item?
It should of course have customer info too.
