# GroupOffice platform

What should it do?

## Server side
1. Database ORM
2. JSON REST API (Routing, Saving, fetching, filtering etc.)
3. User authentication
4. Roles and permissions
5. Tagging system. Tags can be global or module specific. For example "Important" could be a global tag but "Customers" would only be relevant for the address book module.
6. Custom fields
7. Module store. Everybody can create modules and deliver them to Intermesh to put them in our module store. Users can browse the store from within Group-Office and click on an install button to install them.

## Client side
1. Angular JS core components
2. HTML with SCSS / CSS components
